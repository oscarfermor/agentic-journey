It serves as a practical journey from understanding basic agent concepts to implementing complex multi-agent systems.

## üóÇÔ∏è Repository Structure

### `/zero-to-one`

**Learning Agentic Patterns** - Fundamental patterns for building AI agents

This section covers core agentic patterns with practical implementations:

- **Prompt Chaining** (`prompt_chaining.py`) - Sequential LLM workflows for predictable multi-step tasks
- **Routing** (`routing.py`) - Intelligent task routing to specialized agents
- **Parallelization** (`parallelization.py`) - Parallel processing of independent subtasks
- **Reflection** (`reflection.py`) - Self-evaluation and iterative refinement patterns
- **Function Calling** (`function_calling.py`) - Tool use and external API integration
- **Planning** (`planning.py`) - Orchestrator-worker pattern for complex task decomposition
- **Multi-Agent** (`multi_agent.py`) - Coordinator and swarm approaches for collaborative agents

**Key Concepts:**

- Workflows vs Agents: When to use deterministic workflows vs non-deterministic agents
- Complexity management: Seeking simplest solutions first
- Error handling and retry mechanisms
- Self-correction capabilities

**Technologies:** Google Generative AI, LangChain

### `/langchain/deep-agents`

**Deep Agents from Scratch** - Building production-ready agents using LangGraph

An educational course demonstrating how to build advanced AI agents with context engineering techniques. This section provides progressive tutorials for building research-capable agents.

**Core Components:**

- `src/deep_agents_from_scratch/` - Implementation source code
  - `state.py` - State management with TODOs and virtual files
  - `file_tools.py` - Virtual file system operations (ls, read, write, edit)
  - `todo_tools.py` - Task planning and tracking
  - `research_tools.py` - Web search and research capabilities

**Tutorial Notebooks:**

1. `0_create_agent.ipynb` - Basic ReAct loop implementation
2. `1_todo.ipynb` - Task planning foundations with TODO lists
3. `2_files.ipynb` - Virtual file systems for context offloading
4. `3_subagents.ipynb` - Sub-agent delegation and context isolation
5. `4_full_agent.ipynb` - Complete research agent combining all patterns

**Key Patterns:**

- Context engineering: Task planning, file offloading, context isolation
- ReAct loops: Reason-Act pattern for agent decision making
- Sub-agent spawning: Creating specialized agents for specific tasks
- Virtual file systems: Storing context in agent state

**Technologies:** LangGraph, LangChain, Anthropic (Claude), Tavily

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

### Quick Start

#### For Zero-to-One Learning Patterns

```bash
cd zero-to-one
pip install -r requirements.txt
python prompt_chaining.py  # Or any other pattern file
```

#### For Deep Agents from Scratch

```bash
cd langchain/deep-agents/deep-agents-from-scratch

# Install dependencies using uv
uv sync

# Create .env file with API keys
cp example.env .env
# Edit .env with your API keys:
# - TAVILY_API_KEY
# - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
# - LANGSMITH_API_KEY (optional)

# Run Jupyter notebooks
uv run jupyter notebook

# Or use LangGraph Studio
langgraph up
```
